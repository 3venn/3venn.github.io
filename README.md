## Explain the intersection between three groups

1) The three groups are not usually grouped together, so good answers must involve original thinking. Or not, ie you are free to play the game wrong.

2) The wrongest of all wrong answers will recieve bonus* points**.

*Bonus points are worth 10X more than regular points.

**Nobody is actually keeping score when it comes any kind of points. You are free to keep score, thus this game is much like your reputation, ie except for you, nobody else cares.
