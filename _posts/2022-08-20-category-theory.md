# Category Theory
Category Theory, is like Set Theory, except Category Theory is focused on relations or morphism between the objects in sets ... it's all about connections or distinctions or ways that objects and sets relate to other others and sets.

You can start with [Awesome Category Theory](https://github.com/gbroques/awesome-category-theory) or maybe [the "Categpry Theory" topic](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/category+theory) in the [**nlab** collaborative wiki on Mathematics, Physics, and Philosophy](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage).
