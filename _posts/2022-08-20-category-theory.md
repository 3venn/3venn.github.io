# Category Theory
Category Theory, is like Set Theory, except Category Theory is focused on relations or morphism between the objects in sets ... it's all about connections or distinctions or ways that objects and sets relate to other others and sets ... it would be a gross understatement to say that Category Theory matters a lot in search/recommendation engines or artificial intelligence ... accordingly, there's a lot of background that one needs to pick up to even have a sense of how huge the topic is.

We all start somewhere ... a good place might be something like [Awesome Category Theory](https://github.com/gbroques/awesome-category-theory) or maybe you would prefer something like [the "Categpry Theory" topic](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/category+theory) in the [**nlab** collaborative wiki on Mathematics, Physics, and Philosophy](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage) ... just realize that those curated collections or wiki are only the start.
